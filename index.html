				<h3>SRS Complete!</h3>
				<p>
					After quite a bit of work we were able to complete the SRS document, and finalized everything we would like to have as a feature. This week, Jared could not make the meeting, so the night before he did his share of work on the SRS as well as the blog posting. He also was around for support during the meeting, but just had to be at another one nearby in the team rooms. For the HTA portion of the SRS, everybody did one with Benjin and Jared doing an additional one each for the required six. Benjin, Kevin, and Tyler were all at the meeting and worked on the SRS. Some key features that they focused on were System Features, User Classes, and Nonfunctional Requirements. Next week we hope to finish a portion of the third deliverable. Realistically most of the team's effort will probably be focused on assignment two and not much will be done in terms of the team oriented work. We additionally hope to receive top marks on our exams back Wednesday!

				<h3>A quick Message</h3>

				This is just a quick little test post to make sure that the look is right and that everyone can get a general idea of what the site will look like. We are Collective A, and we are a team of Software Engineers who are working together for a project demonstrating our ability in Software Usability. We have submitted three project proposals to our instructor where she will pick one of her choice. They are:
