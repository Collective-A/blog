				<h3>A Little About Jared</h3>
				<image src='images/jared.jpg' class="picture" />
				<p>
					My name is Jared Smith and I am from Fleming, New York. I goto school for Software Engineering and am currently looking into having an application domain in Software Development. In the summer I have been working for my grandparent's company (Moulton's Tent&Canvas Shop). This is my last summer working there because I will either be on co-op or have a job in my area of study by that time. I came into college with little to no programming ability and made it out unscathed (except now I have to work extra hard to get my GPA to where I would like). I love learning and solving problems, which is why I have chosen a career path where you will never know everything and where the main part of your job is to take complex problems that as far as others are concerned is magic, and break them down so that they can be completed on time and in a way that is easy for others to understand.

				<h3>Hobbies</h3>
				<p>	
					 Some hobbies I like include soccer, investing, exercise, reading (when I can), travel, art (when I can), snowboarding, and personal learning. Currently I am working on French at <a href="duolingo.com/#/j4r3d54">duolingo</a> and Arabic with my friends (native speakers). Also I have taken it upon myself to learn HTML and CSS since I had not learned it in school yet. Most of my schooling for that is from <a href="teamtreehouse.com">Treehouse</a> and I hope to build up to Objective-C for iOS development. For travel I have gone to Toronto,Canada (to see Daniel Tosh) and to Dubai, U.A.E (to visit friends). I hope to go to Saudi Arabia this winter to visit some friends, should I have the time.

				<h3>Experience</h3>
				<p>	
					 I have experience with several languages such as Java and Ruby, and have worked with Python, Objective-C, C, and Ruby on Rails (only very minimal exposure although C and Python I just haven't done in a while). I also have experience working on projects in groups, and know a good amount of design patterns so I would like to think that I can pick up a language fairly quickly given my background and experience with other languages and programming methodologies. As noted before I also have experience in HTML and CSS, but I have also played a little with HTML5 and CSS3 as well but am not very proficient in it.
