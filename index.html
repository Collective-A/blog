				<h3>Off Week</h3>
				<p>
					This week:
					<ul>
					<li>Benjin - Worked on the prototype (about 110 minutes)</li>
					<li>Jared  - Did the blog post (around 10 minutes)</li>
					<li>Kevin  - Helped out with the prototype (70 minutes)</li>
					<li>Tyler  - Got a head start on the assignments/deliverables for next week. (almost 30 minutes)</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					Next week:
					<ul>
					<li>Benjin - Will work on System Prototype. (3 hours)</li>
					<li>Jared  - Will work with the group on creating the prototype. Get the Kinect. (2 hours)</li>
					<li>Kevin  - Help with the prototype. (2.5 hours)</li>
					<li>Tyler  - Help us be prepared for t he heuristic evaluations with the work done this week. (1.5 hours)</li>
					</ul>
					Most of this will be done during our team meeting, but Jared is expected to get the Kinect on Monday (UPS permitting) while Benjin and Kevin work on the prototype (what they can) now. Once we have the Kinect Tyler and I will get into development as well, taking in to account what we have learned about usability thus far.

				<h3>Off Week</h3>
				<p>
					This week:
					<ul>
					<li>Benjin - Did assignment 2 on Nokia's City Lens. (about 60 minutes)</li>
					<li>Jared  - Wrote about the Apple v Samsung case and what it means for UI/UX patenting. (~80 minutes)</li>
					<li>Kevin  - Worked on his assignment 2 concerning Android's intention in using NFC. (45 minutes)</li>
					<li>Tyler  - Chose to do Ice Cream Sandwich's UI for the assignment. (almost 65 minutes)</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					Next week:
					<ul>
					<li>Benjin - Will work on the design document, as well as come up with one prototype. (2 hours)</li>
					<li>Jared  - Will work with the group on creating the design document and create a static prototype. (2 hours)</li>
					<li>Kevin  - Meet up with the group and contribute to the second deliverable. (2 hours)</li>
					<li>Tyler  - Attend our team meeting so that we can work on our prototypes together. (2 hours)</li>
					</ul>
					Note : The team meeting will take place in the team rooms for two hours where in that time we hope to collectively finish the design document. Specific tasks completed by each teammate will be the entire document as we will be working on it through Google docs so everyone will work on everything. In addition to the design document we will work on our prototypes so that we can have similar look and feel throughout the different represented tasks.

				<h3>SRS Complete!</h3>
				<p>
					After quite a bit of work we were able to complete the SRS document, and finalized everything we would like to have as a feature. This week, Jared could not make the meeting, so the night before he did his share of work on the SRS as well as the blog posting. He also was around for support during the meeting, but just had to be at another one nearby in the team rooms. For the HTA portion of the SRS, everybody did one with Benjin and Jared doing an additional one each for the required six. Benjin, Kevin, and Tyler were all at the meeting and worked on the SRS. Some key features that they focused on were System Features, User Classes, and Nonfunctional Requirements. Next week we hope to finish a portion of the third deliverable. Realistically most of the team's effort will probably be focused on assignment two and not much will be done in terms of the team oriented work. We additionally hope to receive top marks on our exams back Wednesday!

				<h3>A quick Message</h3>
				<p>
				This is just a quick little test post to make sure that the look is right and that everyone can get a general idea of what the site will look like. We are Collective A, and we are a team of Software Engineers who are working together for a project demonstrating our ability in Software Usability. We have submitted three project proposals to our instructor where she will pick one of her choice. They are:				
				</p>
				<ul class="proposals">
					<li>
						Interactive Google Earth using Microsoft Kinect
					</li>
					<li>
						Virtual Stock Trading on the Windows Phone Platform
					</li>
					<li>
						Voice Controlled Gym Assistant using the Android SDK
					</li>
				</ul>
